# Freevalve_Arduino
Codebase for the Arduino Freevalve Project- found here: www.youtube.com/c/wesleykagan 

Okay, so this is a super early stage of this project, but as of this post, it does work in the configuration uploaded.

If you want to do nothing else becides make the test engine run, edit the two degree functions as noted in the comments. One is intake, one is exhaust. It will require some
tweaking to perfectly work. My values were around 252 degrees Open and 102 Close (next cycle) For exhaust, and then 30 degrees open and 252 Closed for intake. I will update as I get a better understanding of the abilities- there's a few odd things with this cam that I'm still working through.
