# Freevalve_Arduino
Codebase for the Arduino Freevalve Project- found here: www.youtube.com/c/wesleykagan 

Okay, so this is a super early stage of this project, but as of this post, it does work in the configuration uploaded.

If you want to do nothing else becides make the test engine run, edit the two degree functions as noted in the comments. One is intake, one is exhaust. It will require some
tweaking to perfectly work.
